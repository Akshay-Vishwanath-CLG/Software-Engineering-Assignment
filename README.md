<b>Team Decision Process:</b><br>

For decisions, we’ll use a majority vote. We’ll schedule a call for the voting process, and we’ll record the minutes of the meeting (MoM). To ensure transparency, we’ll create or update documentation based on the team’s decision. A decision will pass if  3 out of 5 team members up-vote it.<br>

<b>Team Contact:</b><br>

External contacts can reach us via email or by contacting any team member directly. If a decision involving the team is needed, we’ll arrange a meeting with all team members and the external party. After the meeting, we’ll record the minutes of the meeting (MoM), update the documentation, and push it to GitHub.<br>
